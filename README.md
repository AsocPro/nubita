# nubita
A small/home cloud management platform.

Note: This project is a hobby and is very early in development. At this point features and functionality can change without notice. In the future my plan is to have more feature/functionality stability. My current plan is I will create a 1.0 release when this happens. 

## Project Goals

This project isn't meant to be a heavy handed all encompassing platform management tool. Instead the goal is simply add some of the nice to haves of other "cloud in a box" or self hosted home NAS/app server solutions.
It will likely start as a bunch of shell scripts and expand from there into who knows what else. I dont have current plans to create a full ready to go OS image but moreso am focused on somthing thay can be installed on top of any standard Linux distribution.

## Features

These are the planned and current features of nubita.

### Current Features

 - A readme file with hopes and aspirations. 

### Planned Features

 - Manage containerized applications
 - Check for updates for containerized applications
 - Easily access release notes for updated applications to easily check fornbreaking changes. 

## System Requirements

Some program to read this text file with. vim is optimal but cat or less will do just fine as well.
